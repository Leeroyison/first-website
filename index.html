    <h1>Hey Noah</h1>
    <p>Fools will paint with b<b>r</b>oad strok<b>e</b>s,
Throw large loops,
And apply utterly meaningless labels
To the wi<b>d</b>e swat<b>h</b> of subj<b>e</b>cts
Which they will not even t<b>r</b>y to unde<b>r</b>stand.
Common man & academ<b>i</b>c-
There will be ma<b>n</b>y who approach you
With the <b>g</b>uise <b>o</b>f knowledge,
Some th<b>r</b>ough the v<b>is</b>age of an educat<b>i</b>on,
But will speak and show
<b>T</b>heir teaching was not adequate
Lacking and inappropriate.
Character defects<b>?</b> Poor teacher<b>s</b>?
And, y<b>ou</b> ask, whe<b>r</b>e do I fit?
What do I know?
Evidently more if you have the will to ask,
The strength to ac<b>ce</b>pt the honest answer.</p>
